## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a data analyst leveraging the power of Tableau to transform complex datasets into interactive dashboards that tell compelling stories. This repository showcases examples of visual storytelling, data integration, and dashboard performance optimization to support data-driven decision-making across a wide range of industries.

Tableau is a leading platform for business intelligence and data visualization, enabling users to explore and communicate data with clarity and precision. My work emphasizes not only how data is displayed, but how it informs and engages its audience through thoughtful design and interactivity.

Visual Storytelling: Each dashboard in this repository is crafted with a focus on narrative flowâ€”highlighting key metrics, trends, and insights using intuitive charts, filters, and calculated fields. I incorporate design principles such as color theory, layout consistency, and user-centered navigation to guide viewers through the data story effectively.

Data Connections: From Excel files and cloud databases to live connections with platforms like Snowflake and Google BigQuery, this repository features a variety of data source integrations. Projects include steps for cleaning, joining, and shaping data within Tableau Prep or directly in Tableau Desktop to ensure a solid foundation for analysis.

Performance Tuning: Dashboard speed and responsiveness are critical. I apply performance best practices such as extract optimization, aggregating data at the source, minimizing complex calculations, and using context filters wisely. These techniques help ensure that dashboards load quickly and scale with growing data volumes.

This repository is ideal for analysts, business users, and data visualization enthusiasts looking to enhance their Tableau skills. Each project includes sample datasets, walkthroughs, and design notes to support learning and reuse.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contributeâ€”great dashboards start with meaningful data and clear storytelling.
